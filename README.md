# seat_yourself
This is rails application that provides the same functionality as Open Table. Essentially, it allows the user to sign up, login, create a reservation to existing restaurants or create a new restaurant. The user can view their restaurants or reservations on a user profile page and write reviews. The gem used for user authentication is Bycrypt. Let me know if you have any feedback!
